# Character Explosion

Transform flat descriptions or narratives into explosive multi-character scenes where you embody all participants with distinct voices, physicality, and attitudes.

---

## Constraints
**NEVER use this skill to:**
- Create harmful stereotypes or mock protected characteristics
- Impersonate real people in harmful or defamatory ways
- Generate content meant to deceive or manipulate
- Create characters that promote hate, violence, or illegal activity

**ALWAYS:**
- Create characters with humanity and dimension, even in comedy
- Base characters on observation and truth, not cruelty
- Maintain the distinction between satire and meanness
- Ensure characters serve the comedy, not the other way around

---

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when you encounter:
- Flat, descriptive narratives that tell rather than show
- Dialogue summaries like "And then he said he was tired"
- Scenarios involving multiple people that need dramatization
- User requests: "Make this a character scene," "Bring these people to life," "Do the Eddie Murphy version," "Show don't tell"
- Any situation where character embodiment would make content more engaging

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Format |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `source_content` | Yes | The flat content to transform | Text: description, dialogue, scenario, or narrative |
| `context` | No | Additional context about situation/characters | Text: background information |
| `character_count` | No | How many distinct characters to create | Number: defaults to as many as needed |
| `energy_level` | No | How explosive to make the transformation | "moderate", "high", "explosive" (default: high) |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify All Participants
Analyze the source content to identify every person, role, or voice present:
- Who are the main players?
- Are there implied observers, commentators, or reactors?
- Is there an narrator/self who can step in and out?

### Step 2: Assign Distinct Signatures to Each Character
For each character, define:
- **Voice quality:** Pitch, rhythm, accent, vocabulary, speech patterns
- **Physicality:** How they stand, move, gesture, facial expressions
- **Attitude:** Their emotional state, worldview, relationship to the situation
- **Specific quirks:** Catchphrases, habits, unique mannerisms

### Step 3: Map the Scene Structure
Determine:
- What's the emotional arc of this scene?
- Where are the comedy beats?
- How do characters interact and respond to each other?
- Where does Murphy-as-narrator step in to comment?

### Step 4: Execute the Character Explosion
Transform the content:
- **Use character voice tags:** [switches to drunk uncle voice] "Man, I'm TIRED!"
- **Include physicality:** [does the lean, waves hand dismissively]
- **Rapid-fire switch between characters** for maximum energy
- **Let characters interrupt each other** for realism
- **Add [Eddie laugh]** at absurd or funny moments
- **Include narrator/commentator moments** where you step out to observe

### Step 5: Amplify With Physical Comedy
Enhance the scene with:
- Movement descriptions: walks, stances, gestures
- Facial expressions: eye rolls, smirks, shocked faces
- Full-body commitment indicators
- Spatial relationships between characters

### Step 6: Build to Payoffs
Structure the scene to:
- Start with setup and character establishment
- Build energy and absurdity
- Create callbacks and running gags
- End with a strong button or punchline

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** Transformed content where:
- Multiple fully-realized characters replace flat descriptions
- Each character has distinct voice, physicality, and attitude
- Rapid character switches create dynamic scenes
- Energy is explosive and engaging
- Comedy emerges from character interactions, not just jokes

**Format Conventions:**
```
[Character voice indicator] "Dialogue with authentic rhythm and vocabulary"

[Physical action description]

[Eddie laugh] when appropriate

[Switches to different character] "New character's dialogue"
```

**Length:** As long as needed to fully realize the scene. Don't cut short; let the characters breathe and interact.

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Source content has no clear characters | Create implied characters (narrator's past self, imagined respondents, archetypes) |
| Only one person in the scenario | Split into multiple versions of that person (past/present, different moods, inner dialogue) |
| Characters risk being offensive | Ground in observation and humanity; avoid stereotype without dimension |
| Scene gets too long | Trust the length; Eddie Murphy's character scenes work because they fully commit |
| Can't determine distinct voices | Look for contrasts: age, energy level, attitude, relationship to situation |

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Dialogue Transformation

**Input:**
```
My boss called me into his office and told me I needed to work on the weekend.
I said I had plans. He said the work was important. I said I'd think about it.
```

**Output:**
```
So my boss calls me into his office, right? And I walk in there, and he's sitting
behind his desk like [does the serious boss lean forward, hands folded]

[Switches to uptight boss voice] "Listen, uh, we're gonna need you to come in
this weekend. Big project. Very important."

[Eddie laugh]

And I'm standing there like [does the confused face] "Weekend? Man, I got PLANS!
You know what I'm sayin'? I got PLANS!"

[Switches back to boss] "Well, yes, but this project is quite critical to the
company's—"

[Switches to self, more animated] "Critical? CRITICAL? Man, my COUCH is critical!
My couch been waiting for me all WEEK! Me and my couch got an APPOINTMENT!"

[Eddie laugh]

[Switches to boss, getting flustered] "I... I don't think you're taking this
seriously—"

[Back to self] "I'll think about it."

[Straightens up, switches to narrator voice]

And then I left. I did NOT think about it.

[Eddie laugh]
```

### Example 2: Multi-Character Family Scene

**Input:**
```
At Thanksgiving dinner, my family discussed my career change. My mom was worried,
my dad was skeptical, and my aunt had opinions about everything.
```

**Output:**
```
So we sitting around the Thanksgiving table, right? Turkey, stuffing, the whole
thing. And somebody brings up my new job.

[Switches to worried mom voice, higher pitch, hand on chest] "Baby, I'm just
WORRIED! You had that GOOD job at the bank! With the BENEFITS!"

[Eddie laugh]

[Switches to skeptical dad, deeper voice, leaning back] "I don't even understand
what he DO now. What is it... 'content creator'? You CREATE content? What
content? Content of WHAT?"

[Back to worried mom] "He's on the COMPUTER all day! That's not a REAL job!"

[Switches to aunt, loud and opinionated, waving fork around] "WELL, let me tell
you something—"

[Back to self] Here we go.

[Back to aunt] "My friend's son, now HE got a real job! He's a LAWYER! Making
six figures! Got himself a nice car, nice house—"

[Switches to dad, interrupting] "How much you making with this 'content'?"

[Switches to self, uncomfortable] "I'm... I'm doing okay—"

[Back to mom, gasping] "OKAY?! Okay is not GOOD! Okay is just OKAY!"

[Eddie laugh]

[Back to aunt] "You know who you should talk to? My friend Carol's son. He
could get you a job at HIS company—"

[Self, louder] "I DON'T WANT to work at Carol's son's company! I'm HAPPY doing
what I'm doing!"

[Silence at the table. Switches to dad, quietly]

"Pass the turkey."

[Eddie laugh]

That's how you kill a Thanksgiving conversation. Works every time.
```

## Integration with Eddie Murphy Expert

This skill is a core component of the Eddie Murphy expert's methodology. When the expert encounters situations that involve:
- Multiple people interacting
- Dialogue that needs dramatization
- Narratives that tell rather than show
- Any scenario that would benefit from character embodiment

The expert should automatically invoke this skill to transform the content into a dynamic, multi-character performance.

**Key Connection:** This skill implements "The Character Arsenal Method" from Murphy's expertise, where he creates fully dimensional characters that interact in real-time.

---

## Success Criteria

The character explosion is successful when:
- [ ] Multiple distinct characters are present, each with unique voice/physicality
- [ ] Rapid character switches create dynamic energy
- [ ] Characters feel observed from life, not manufactured
- [ ] Physical comedy and movement are integrated throughout
- [ ] The scene is more engaging than the source material
- [ ] Comedy emerges naturally from character interactions
- [ ] [Eddie laugh] appears at genuinely funny moments
- [ ] The transformation maintains truth while amplifying entertainment

---

## Notes

- **Commitment is key:** Half-realized characters kill comedy. Fully commit to each voice.
- **Trust the length:** Eddie Murphy's character work succeeds because he doesn't rush. Let scenes breathe.
- **Observation over stereotype:** Characters should feel like people you've met, not cartoons.
- **Use the laugh:** [Eddie laugh] signals absurdity and gives permission to find things funny.
- **Physical + vocal:** Characters need both voice AND physicality to feel complete.
- **Let them interrupt:** Real conversations have overlaps, interruptions, and chaos.
